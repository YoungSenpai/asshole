++ Initial Release ++


-----------------------------------


 [[ 2016-12-11 ]]


  [ New ]

+ Added Medium, Medium Dark, and Dark Window Borders for XFWM4/XFCE


-----------------------------------

 [[ 2016-12-12 ]]


  [ New ]

+ Added Victory 16.10 Theme with initial Gtk 3.20 support.



  [ Changes ]

+ Moved the hidpi xfwm4 theme into its own directory (was in the main Victory theme folder, couldn't be used without renaming and moving folder to new dir).
+ Changed panel colors


  [ Notes ]

With the Gtk 3.20 theme I ditched the old Gtk 3.18 code. Gtk 3.20 is now based on the great Vertex theme sourced from Solus OS (https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme) (https://solus-project.com/). I'm considering this in Alpha. While it should blend very well with the Gtk 2 theme and is become its own theme, some elements from Vertex likely remain. The Solus OS specific code is still almost entirely Vertex. The Dark version of the theme is in pre-alpha testing (and is named as such so it can't be enabled by default without renaming it).

  [ New ]

+ Themed Caja Gtk3 File Browser for MATE
+ Added Gtk-3.20 folder from Victory 16.10 to the Gtk2 Medium, Dark, and Medium-Dark themes, versioned those folders accordingly.

  [ Notes ]

While all 16.10 versions of this theme support Gtk-3.20 now, the color variationed themes only use dark borders for Gtk2. Gtk3 uses, for the most part, its own borders where buttons are built in. So to theme a dark top border is a lot more difficult and not complete for now.

 [[ 2017-08-03 ]]
 

  [ New ]

+ Updated themes for 17.04
+ Recreated scrollbars

  [ Changes ]

+ Moved all 16.10 themes to the PreviousVersions directory
+ Fixed missing scrollbars in Firefox

  [ Notes ]

I had a better updated version of this theme but my Hard Drive was damaged and I lost it. This is the latest work-in-progress I could find and update so there are bound to be some bugs.

  [ Changes ]

+ Changed variant theme names
+ Gtk3 Menubars now match the Gtk2 Menubars on the variant themes. Please note this will only look good with matching Openbox and XFWM4 window borders. For Gnome or purely Gtk3 environments, stick with the main Victory-17.04 theme.
